# Round-Robin-for-Netwok-Packets
In this project the goal is to create a GUI that similates an example of how a Round Robin schedule would work on network packets
Once you run project, a simple GUI will pop up with a textField and a button.
in the textfield, you should enter the string you would like to send, and click enter to submit them
once you click the button, you will send all strings
the system will output the string you sent, and it's arrival time, the packet length (said to be the string's length in this program), the waiting time, and the TAT.
The strings will start showing in a pop up message one after the other depending on the time set by the TAT, representing the scheduling of the packets
